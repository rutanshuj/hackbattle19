We are on our way to colonise the red neighbouring planet - Mars. 
With Elon Musk looking at around 1 million people to be transported to our new home the growing need for 
suitable places to stay would increase. We aim to offer a solution of a smart portal where future Martians 👦👧 
can decide where to stay based on a recommendation system 💻. This system would look at oxygen content, 
ground moisture and various other factors to suggest locations on Mars such that we can find habitable places. 
If possible then also a decentralised block-chain model of Housing 🏠 system that would allow a secure future on the red planet.

Made with ❤️
