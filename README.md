We are on our way to colonise the red neighbouring planet - Mars. 
With Elon Musk looking at around 1 million people to be transported to our new home the growing need for 
suitable places to stay would increase. We aim to offer a solution of a smart portal where future Martians 
can decide where to stay based on a recommendation system. This system would look at oxygen content, 
soil moisture and suggest locations on Mars such that we can find habitable places. 
If possible then also a decentralised block-chain model of Housing system that would allow a secure future on the red planet.
